**Introduction:**
The Arduino Integrated Library Management System is an innovative solution designed to enhance traditional library management using Arduino microcontrollers. This system automates core library operations, improves accuracy, and provides a user-friendly interface for both library staff and patrons.

**Project Note:**
This project was developed as part of an educational project for the 2024 ICT Summit at STI College Las Piñas.

**Objectives:**
- **Automation:** Automate book tracking, borrowing, and returning processes.
- **Efficiency:** Manage large collections efficiently for streamlined operations.
- **Accessibility:** Provide user-friendly interfaces, including self-checkout kiosks.
- **Data Analysis:** Gather valuable data on library usage for informed decision-making.
- **Cost-Effectiveness:** Offer a cost-effective solution suitable for libraries with limited budgets.
- **Scalability:** Scale the system for libraries of varying sizes.

**Overview of Current Technology:**
The Arduino Integrated Library Management System leverages Arduino microcontrollers and related technologies to automate core library operations. Current implementations include sensors for accurate book tracking, QR code systems for book accumulation, and integration with desktop or online platforms.
